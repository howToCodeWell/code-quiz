# Code Quiz
Welcome to the Code Quiz Open Source project from [How To Code Well](https://howtocodewell.net). 

This is an Open Source project that includes an API and an App for the daily code quizzes.

The daily code quizzes are published to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/howtocodewell) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/howtocodewell). This GitHub project is under development and will eventually allow access to the quizzes via a JSON API, Mobile app and website. 

This Monorepo contains the following three projects.

1. **API** - A Symfony 6, PHP 8  and Maria DB backend.
2. **API-Client** - A NPM package for mock testing the API. 
3. **App** - A Mobile application that displays code quizzes.
4. **Website** - A Website that displays code quizzes.
